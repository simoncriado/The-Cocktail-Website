# The Cocktail Website

Project done during the bootcamp I did back in 2019. This project had to be an own creation from the design part, through the developing process until the final deployment. Key project functionalities:

  - Information about cocktails and spirits for non-registered users.
  - Login functionality to have access to the extra feature: the chat rooms to chat with other cocktail-lovers.
  - Search-bar.

## Tech used

HTML, CSS, Vue and Firebase.
